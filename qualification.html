                                The Leaving Certificate examination is the Irish Equivalent of the A-Level. It is a two-year course that is taken by all students in Ireland.
                                The Leaving Certificate is a requirement for entry to third-level education in Ireland.

                              <br>
                              The course gives students a fundamental understanding of the principles of computer science, as well as the ability to apply these principles to solve real-world problems.
                              Unlike other courses, this course adds a core module on a language (German, Chinese, or Korean) as well as modules on globalism and software in the context of international inclusion.

                              In your third year, you can choose to study or work abroad for a semester. Students of Computer Science (International) will graduate with a BSc in Computer Science and a BA in their language.

                              Throughout the day, my team and I solved a variety of challenges, ranging from simple web challenges to more complex reverse engineering challenges,
                              infiltration and general knowledge, we competed against a variety of other teams, ranging from fellow college students studying Cybersecurity to professionals in the field.
                              Despite being first-year students, we competed well and came second overall.

                                Zerodays is a Capture the Flag competition that gameifies cybersecurity. I attended their TU Dublin event hosted by the Ethical Hackers Society, this was my first ever CTF, and I had a great time.

                                My team and I competed against teams of other students from TU Dublin. Tasks involved reverse-engineering, web exploits, cryptography, lock picking and other fun tasks. Over the course of a few hours we solved many challenges and came first by a large margin.

                                Because of this, we won tickets to IRISSCERT which allowed us to compete in the IRISSCON CTF.
