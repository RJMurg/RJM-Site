                                Ironroad is a Python project which uses the Irish Rail API to get real-time data
                                about all trains on the network.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                As my first Python project, I faced many hurdles, such as parsing the
                                non-standard API and doing typo-correction. I am very proud of the project, and
                                personally use it regularly. Currently, I am fixing edge-cases caused by the API,
                                and adding QoL changes.

                                Currently, Ironroad is being <a href="https://github.com/IrishTnT/Ironroad/tree/web">rewritten in SvelteKit</a>, and will be deployed as a web app.

                                It was created for CS++, the Computer Science Society of TU Dublin, which I am chairing for the 2023/24 academic year.
                                It's first production deployment will be the 2023 Freshers' Treasure Hunt, where First-Year students can learn the campus and win prizes.

                                SIM (Short for 'Shop Inventory Manager') started as a simple date-checking program for the shop I work in.
                                It was originally written as an ExpressJS app, using 'ETA' as its templating engine. The initial Proof-of-Concept was written in a weekend.

                                This allowed a much more flexible and powerful system that was significantly faster and more reliable.

                                TrackEngine was my first ever attempt at an API. It was written in NodeJS, and used ExpressJS as its framework.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                With the aim of writing Ironroad Web in SvelteKit,
                                I realised that the XML <a href="https://api.irishrail.ie/realtime">Irish Rail API</a> was not suitable for use in a web app.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                TrackEngine was my solution to this problem, it takes the XML data from the Irish Rail API, and convert it to JSON,
                                and do some pre-processing to return easier-to-handle data. You can read the docs <a href="https://api.irishtnt.com/tracksmith">here</a>.

                                The Spanish Tragedy is a play written by Thomas Kyd in the late 1500s.
                                It is a classic tragedy focusing on the downfall of a family and the revenge of a father.

                                <br>
                                This production was done as part of Dublin Youth Theatre's 'Big Show' summertime performance, and was performed in the Project Arts Centre.
                                Directed by Aoife Spillane-Hinks, I worked with Sarah-Jane Shiels and SÃ­ofra Nic Liam on lighting.
                                Sarah-Jane was the Lighting Designer for the production and has worked on over fifty high-profile productions.
                                In this experience, I expanded my knowledge of lighting design, rigging, and safety for large venues.

                              As a member of Dublin Youth Theatre since 2017, I have been involved in the vast majority of their productions.
                              Starting in 2018, I moved to technical theatre, and have focused on lighting since.

                              <br>
                              This year was my first year as Lighting Designer and for the first time, it fell to me to design the lighting for two shows performed back-to-back.
                              DYT's One-Act Festivals present a unique challenge for Lighting Design as you must suffeciently light two shows with only one rig.

                              In 2023, I continued to be the Lighting Designer for DYT's One-Act Festivals, this time for three shows.
                              This time around, the shows were much grander in scale, and I had to design a rig that could be used for all three shows and cater for a much larger cast.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              I used the experience from the previous year to design a much more advanced rig during the rehearsal period,
                              refining the design as the shows were rehearsed, and adding new features as they were needed.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              This year, I also co-facilitated DYT's first ever members-led lighting workshop, where I taught the basics of lighting design and operation to other members.
