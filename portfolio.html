                                Ironroad is a Python project which uses the Irish Rail API to get real-time data
                                about all trains on the network.

                                <br>
                                As my first Python project, I faced many hurdles, such as parsing the
                                non-standard API and doing typo-correction. I am very proud of the project, and
                                personally use it regularly. Currently, I am fixing edge-cases caused by the API,
                                and adding QoL changes.

                                What originally started as a <a href="files/EducationSystem.pdf">PDF</a> that made it easier to talk to my friends about secondary school has now been evolved to be a Google Translate-style converter.

                                <br>
                                When talking to Americans, for example, I could talk about Sixth Year as '12th Grade' and they'd understand the age range and the standard of education.

                                The PDF only has four countries, and to expand that, and to make it easier to convert, I decided to change the translator to a webpage which used JavaScript.

                                The Spanish Tragedy is a play written by Thomas Kyd in the late 1500s.
                                It is a classic tragedy focusing on the downfall of a family and the revenge of a father.

                                This production was done as part of Dublin Youth Theatre's 'Big Show' summertime performance, and was performed in the Project Arts Centre.
                                Directed by Aoife Spillane-Hinks, I worked with Sarah-Jane Shiels and Síofra Nic Liam on lighting.
                                Sarah-Jane was the Lighting Designer for the production and has worked on over fifty high-profile productions.
                                In this experience, I expanded my knowledge of lighting design, rigging, and safety for large venues.

                              As a member of Dublin Youth Theatre since 2017, I have been involved in the vast majority of their productions.
                              Starting in 2018, I moved to technical theatre, and have focused on lighting since.

                              <br>
                              This year was my first year as Lighting Designer and for the first time, it fell to me to design the lighting for two shows performed back-to-back.
                              DYT's One-Act Festivals present a unique challenge for Lighting Design as you must suffeciently light two shows with only one rig.

                                In one of the games I play, one of the objectives is to operate a machine called the 'Crystal Analysis Machine'.
                                This machine is quite complex, and I wanted to explain it by creating a manual and a tutorial video.
                                Over the course of two days, I wrote the manual and created the video. Both were designed to look like actual material made by the 'Opifex Industries' company.

                                The manual is available <a href="files/CAMManualV4.pdf">here</a>. Overall, both I am very happy with both the manual and the video, and they were excellent learning experiences.
