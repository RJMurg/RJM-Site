                                Ironroad is a Python project which uses the Irish Rail API to get real-time data
                                about all trains on the network.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                As my first Python project, I faced many hurdles, such as parsing the
                                non-standard API and doing typo-correction. I am very proud of the project, and
                                personally use it regularly. Currently, I am fixing edge-cases caused by the API,
                                and adding QoL changes.

                                It was created for CS++, the Computer Science Society of TU Dublin, which I am chairing for the 2023/24 academic year.
                                It's first production deployment will be the 2023 Freshers' Treasure Hunt, where First-Year students can learn the campus and win prizes.

                                SIM (Short for 'Shop Inventory Manager') started as a simple date-checking program for the shop I work in.
                                It was originally written as an ExpressJS app, using 'ETA' as its templating engine.

                                This allowed a much more flexible and powerful system that was significantly faster and more reliable.

                                TrackEngine was my first ever attempt at an API. It was written in NodeJS, and used ExpressJS as its framework.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                With the aim of writing Ironroad Web in SvelteKit,
                                I realised that the XML <a href="https://api.irishrail.ie/realtime">Irish Rail API</a> was not suitable for use in a web app.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                TrackEngine was my solution to this problem, it would take the XML data from the Irish Rail API, and convert it to JSON,
                                and do some pre-processing to return easier-to-handle data. You can read the docs <a href="https://api.irishtnt.com/tracksmith">here</a>.

                                The program had to be able to add students, remove students, and print the students in a course, as well as all of the students in the system.
                                It had to use linked lists, use various sorts to sort the students, and search the students. I added additional features such as a comprehensive test data generator,
                                and a menu system to make it easier to use as well as other small additions to the project requirements to make it more user-friendly.

                                The Spanish Tragedy is a play written by Thomas Kyd in the late 1500s.
                                It is a classic tragedy focusing on the downfall of a family and the revenge of a father.

                                <br>
                                This production was done as part of Dublin Youth Theatre's 'Big Show' summertime performance, and was performed in the Project Arts Centre.
                                Directed by Aoife Spillane-Hinks, I worked with Sarah-Jane Shiels and Síofra Nic Liam on lighting.
                                Sarah-Jane was the Lighting Designer for the production and has worked on over fifty high-profile productions.
                                In this experience, I expanded my knowledge of lighting design, rigging, and safety for large venues.

                              As a member of Dublin Youth Theatre since 2017, I have been involved in the vast majority of their productions.
                              Starting in 2018, I moved to technical theatre, and have focused on lighting since.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              This year was my first year as Lighting Designer and for the first time, it fell to me to design the lighting for two shows performed back-to-back.
                              DYT's One-Act Festivals present a unique challenge for Lighting Design as you must suffeciently light two shows with only one rig.

                            <p>
                              In 2023, I continued to be the Lighting Designer for DYT's One-Act Festivals, this time for three shows.
                              This time around, the shows were much grander in scale, and I had to design a rig that could be used for all three shows and cater for a much larger cast.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              I used the experience from the previous year to design a much more advanced rig during the rehearsal period,
                              refining the design as the shows were rehearsed, and adding new features as they were needed.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              This year, I also co-facilitated DYT's first ever members-led lighting workshop, where I taught the basics of lighting design and operation to other members.

                                In one of the games I play, one of the objectives is to operate a machine called the 'Crystal Analysis Machine'.
                                This machine is quite complex, and I wanted to explain it by creating a manual and a tutorial video.
                                Over the course of two days, I wrote the manual and created the video. Both were designed to look like actual material made by the 'Opifex Industries' company.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The manual is available <a href="files/CAMManualV4.pdf">here</a>. Overall, both I am very happy with both the manual and the video, and they were excellent learning experiences.

                                One-Way and One-Card was a proposed overhaul to the Irish Transport Network,

                                travel plans.

                                as a digital-only card, or as a physical card with a small surcharge.

                            <p>
                                CS++ is the Computer Science Society of TU Dublin, and I was elected chairperson for the 2022/23 academic year.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                As part of my commitment as chairperson, I undertook the task of writing the society's constitution.
                                The primary goal was to create a robust constitution with clearly defined powers, roles, events and procedures.
                                This constitution also had to be flexible enough to allow for changes in the future due to the nature of the society.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                To achieve this, I created a unique office within the Committee called the 'Unenumerated Officer'.
                                Unenumerated offices can be created and removed by the Committee to fill a role that is not covered by the constitution.
                                This exists to be able to select a person to achieve a single task, such as ensuring GDPR compliance, or focusing on a specific element of our tech stack.
                                <br>
                                It was vital that this role have no official stated powers or duties, as it is designed to be a temporary role, lasting no-more than one semester.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Another goal was to provide a strong template for future constitutions both within CS++ and hopefully other societies.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The constitution will be presented and voted upon at the first General Meeting of the 2022/23 academic year.
